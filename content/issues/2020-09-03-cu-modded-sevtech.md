The exact time of the restart is yet to be determined but the modpack to switch to is determined. **drumroll please**

#### Sevtech!

As long as no one objects, we will be switching over the Cooper Union Modded Minecraft server to Sevtech at some undetermined time after {{< htrack "2020-09-05T12:00:00-04:00" >}}. The FTB Revelation server is now in a [1 week scream test period]({{<relref "2020-09-31-cu-modded-revelation-scream" >}}).
