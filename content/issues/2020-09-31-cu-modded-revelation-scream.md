### {{< htrack "2020-09-03T17:45:00-04:00" >}}

Check out [this page]({{< relref "2020-09-03-cu-modded-sevtech" >}}) for information regarding the new modpack.

### {{< htrack "2020-09-02T16:15:00-04:00" >}}

The message of the day on the server has been changed to let all players know of the scream test.

Starting at {{< htrack "2020-09-05T12:00:00-04:00" >}}, the server will stop allowing players to join.

### Entering Scream Test

There is a plan currently being considered to change the modpack being used for the modded server. In order to work towards this goal, the current FTB Revelations modpack will be brought down after an indeterminate amount of time. **Please make some noise on the Discord server if you are still actively playing on the server (or send an email to <gary@garykim.dev> if you don't have Discord).**
