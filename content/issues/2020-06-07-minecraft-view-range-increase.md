The entity view range on **Minecraft: Turtle Server** is getting increased to the following:

* Players: 200 Blocks
* Animals: 96 Blocks
* Monsters: 96 Blocks
* Misc: 64 Blocks
* Other: 96 Blocks

Entity activation range is not getting increased so you will see the entities but they will not be moving until you move into range of them.

The server will also be updated to the latest version of PaperMC during the same restart.

The expected maximum downtime is **10 minutes**. It will likely take about 5 minutes but be prepared for a little bit of extra downtime in case there are issues during the restart.
