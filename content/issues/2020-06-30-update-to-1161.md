### Back up ({{< htrack "2020-07-02T00:05:00+08:00" >}})

The server is back up and running and seems to be runnning fine. Feel free to report any issues you may encounter on the Tech Stuff chat!

We also should not have any strange generation in the nether this time around from accidentally changing the seed of the nether like the first time around (sorry about that).

# Nether Update here we come!

Minecraft: Turtle Server is being updated to PaperMC 1.16.1 at **{{< htrack "2020-07-01T23:00:00+08:00" >}}**. The update is expected to take **1 hour**.

The nether will also be reset in the update so that we can take advantage of the changes in the update. Please use the next 3 days to take any resources you have left in the Nether out of it. Please also make a note of all the portals you have built in the nether so that you don't lose their coordinates in the new nether.

A backup of the old Nether will be kept for worse case scenarios.

### IMPORTANT: Anything left in the Nether by the update time will be lost to time

> Months ago, we began to see signs of decay in the nether. The hub began falling apart, parts of the bedrock ceiling were discovered to have been broken, and the bodies of dead turtles bloated the lakes below. We knew that we would have to leave these gaping caverns behind... and the time to depart is now. At last the great fortresses have begun to crumble into the lakes, glowstone deposts have all but disappeared, quartz has turned black in anticipation. My brothers, my sisters, everyone, now we must flee; this world can sustain itself no longer. Our portals will be the last to closeâ€”it is of the highest importance that you NOT remain in that dimension. For once the portals close, the lava will swallow it whole.
