### {{< htrack "2020-07-21T16:30:00+08:00" >}}

The server is running and is running well. Players will now notice significantly reduced lag while playing on the server.

### {{< htrack "2020-07-21T16:40:00+08:00" >}}

The initial migration is complete and the server is running. The status page will reflect that the server is down for about 15 more minutes as a couple things are checked on the server to ensure that the migration was completed smoothly.

### Initial Message

With the purchase of a new server, the Minecraft server will be migrated over to a new, more powerful server. Downtime will begin at **{{< htrack "2020-07-21T16:00:00+08:00" >}}** and is expected to take **an hour and a half**.

The new server is still only designated New Gamma. It will eventually become the primary Gamma server but the overall migration is expected to take a week.

After the update, players can expect much better performance/less lag while playing on the server.
