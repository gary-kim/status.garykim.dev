The hub began falling apart, parts of the bedrock ceiling were discovered to have been broken, and the bodies of dead turtles bloated the lakes below. We knew that we would have to leave these gaping caverns behind\u0026hellip; and the time to depart is now. At last the great fortresses have begun to crumble into the lakes, glowstone deposts have all but disappeared, quartz has turned black in anticipation. My brothers, my sisters, everyone, now we must flee; this world can sustain itself no longer. Our portals will be the last to closeâ€”it is of the highest importance that you NOT remain in that dimension. For once the portals close, the lava will swallow it whole.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Courtesy of Sam Llamzon\u003c/p\u003e\n"}
